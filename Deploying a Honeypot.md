Running PenTBox to configure a honeypot<br>
Setting up logging to monitor and review honeypot activity<br>
Testing the honeypot by accessing it from a Windows machine using the Kali Linux IP address<br>
Viewing logs on the Kali machine that captures the visiting system's information<br>

## Setting up the Honeypot

Using a Kali Linux machine, I run PenTBox in the command line. To set up
the honeypot I would have to go to "2 - Network Tools" â†’ "3 - Honeypot".
Then, I choose to do manual configuration.

I choose to open the vulnerable HTTP port for the honeypot. This way, it
can act as bait for potential attackers who are probing network
services. I also want a log of any activity in the honeypot that I can
monitor and review later to defend the network.

Now that the honeypot is running, I will log into a windows machine and
test it out.

## Testing the Honeypot

On a Windows Machine, I can just enter the Kali Linux's IP address in a
web browser as the Honeypot deployed by PenTBox is simulating a web
service on port 80.

Now, back on the Kali machine, I see the log generated by the Windows
Machine accessing the web page. I can see information such as the IP
address of the Windows machine, the version, and even the web browser
used.
